# movement-based-voice-enabled-device-switching-and-basic-needs-for-physcially-challenged-person
The project deals with the control of devices and to ask the basic needs like water,food or medicine by using MEMS(Micro Electro-Mechanical systems)technology.MEMS is a Micro Electro Mechanical sensor which is a highly sensitive sensor and capable of detecting the tilt.when the sensor is kept on the right side it going act upon the three modes when it was on first switch it moves right side then ut was on second switch the light will be ON When it has on third switch it announces as i need food. In the same way,if we tilt the MEMS sensor towards to the left side,upwards,downwards direction the instructions are going to be followed. This device is very helpful for paralysics and physically Challenged persons .this device is portable and this system operation is entirely driven by wireless technology.
user can hold with hand and can operate it by tilting the MEMS Sensor.This Project make use of a Switching the devices and APR33A3 Voice chip for audio announcements and micro controller ,which is programmed,with the help of embedded c instructions .the MEMS based sensor detects the tilt and provides the information to the micro controller and the controller judges whether the instruction is right movement or left movement instruction and controls the operation respectively.
